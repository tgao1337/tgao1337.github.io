# personal site test

There is not much to read. This is simply a git version of my personal website with the Animate on scroll.

## Projects include
### GoWhere
### Burger Clicker
### CAD
### TopOpt


Todo: 
add hyperloops, nlp. ~~Use tabs from expos to viwe projects?~~
Also look into react

Google analytics found: 
- Clickable elements too close together
- Content wider than screen

but cannot figure out where the problem is. 

Todo:
- remove aos
- remove instagram
- try implementing and/or updating css elements
- project for website in frame so it recurses
- drawer opens sorta like google images

Sites I like:
- http://annaellenberger.com/
  - header
  - about section
  - grid with hover (use circles for mine)
  - clients section (sorta use this for each of my sections)
  - band/banner near bottom (maybe use this? still not sure what for)
- https://joelrunyon.com/#
  - circular social buttons
- https://www.danielgrindrod.com/
  - call to action "let's make something"
- https://diogotc.com/
  - social hover
  - also add email in social?
  - timeline with animates (maybe use aos but look into vulnerabilities)
  
ideas:
- have drawers for each bubble but have a learn more click thing? and it opens a drawer for the whole page, not just the header?
  - might be too much and useless in the end
